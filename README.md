I love creating things.

I picked up Python and JavaScript during the pandemic in 2020, and what started as a way to pass the time quickly grew into a clear career direction. Since then, I’ve built a solid foundation in several other languages and I’m always looking to learn more. I’ve also been exploring electronics fundamentals, PCB design, and AI. Anything tech-related tends to pull me in.

I’m currently learning German as I work toward pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science abroad.
