I love creating things.

I picked up Python and JavaScript during the pandemic in 2020, and what started as a way to pass the time quickly grew into a clear career direction. Since then I’ve built up a solid foundation in several other languages and I’m always looking to learn more. I’ve also been exploring electronics fundamentals, PCB design, and AI because anything tech‑related tends to pull me in.
